## Install JSON-server:
### npm install -g json-server
allows you to rapidly establish a bogus RESTful API with a JSON file as a data source. It's useful for mimicking a backend server while developing and testing a frontend. The server replies to HTTP requests, enabling you to conduct CRUD operations on the JSON file's data. It's simple to set up and provides a simple way to fake API answers without requiring an actual backend server.

The project makes use of React Router for navigation and the Open Trivia Database API to retrieve trivia questions. Users can build, search, filter, and rank flashcards dynamically. The code structure includes App, FlashcardPage, Flashcard, FlashcardList, and Home components. CSS is used to style the page. Initial setup procedures for the application include Node.js installation, JSON Server configuration for a simulated backend, and project dependency installation. Overall, the code incorporates a user-friendly interface for interactive flashcard learning, resulting in a smooth user experience.
